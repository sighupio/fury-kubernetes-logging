## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

- This release involves recreation of certain resources like daemonset, deployments, etc. We recommend deleting it with `--cascade=orphan`, to avoid changes being made to the pods.
- We drop support of Kubernetes versions <= v1.19.x

## Breaking Changes üíî

- [#47](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-logging/pull/47) Added Kubernetes labels to all the components of the module: Since `labels` are immutable fields in deployments, daemonsets, etc., this change requires a recreation of those resources.

## Features üí•

- [#49](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-logging/pull/49) Added Makefile, JSON builder and .bumpversion config to the module
- [#51](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-logging/pull/51) Update config that prevents fluentd from capturing own logs
- [#52](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-logging/pull/52) Use @label routing
- [#53](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-logging/pull/53) Change default logging level from error to warn
- [#54](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-logging/pull/54) Set human readable fluentd process name
- [#55](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-logging/pull/55) Added e2e-test support for k8s runtime `1.23`
- [#58](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-logging/pull/58) Upgrade elastic search and kibana
- [#59](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-logging/pull/59) Improve kibana index pattern injection via sidecar, remove readinessProbe, thanks to @nutellinoit

## Update Guide ü¶Æ

### Warnings

- Since the release ships changes to some immutable fields, if `deployments`, `statefulset` and `daemonsets`, are not deleted first before applying the module, it will error out.

### Process

To upgrade this core module from `v1.9.x` to `v1.10.0`, you need to download this new version, then apply the `kustomize` project.

```bash
kubectl delete deployments.apps -n logging cerebro --cascade=orphan # This delete deployments, ds, etc. so the newly added labels can be applied
kustomize build katalog/cerebro | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build katalog/curator | kubectl apply -f -
or
kustomize build katalog/curator-s3 | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize delete statefulset.apps/elasticsearch -n logging cerebro --cascade=orphan 
kustomize build katalog/elasticsearch-single | kubectl apply -f -
or
kustomize delete statefulset.apps/elasticsearch -n logging cerebro --cascade=orphan 
kustomize build katalog/elasticsearch-triple | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl delete statefulset.apps/fluentd daemonset.apps/fluentbit -n logging --cascade=orphan
kustomize build katalog/fluentd | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl delete deployment.apps/kibana -n logging --cascade=orphan
kustomize build katalog/kibana | kubectl apply -f -
```
