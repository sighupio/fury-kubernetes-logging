# Logging Core Module Release 4.0.0

Welcome to the latest release of the `logging` module of [`Kubernetes Fury Distribution`](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution) maintained by team SIGHUP.

This update is a major version that adds support for the Kubernetes version 1.30 and 1.31. It also introduces a **breaking change** with the new time series database for Loki [`TSDB`](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/v2.9.x/operations/storage/tsdb/) along with the new [`v13 schema`](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/v2.9.x/operations/storage/schema/).
These changes will improve efficiency, speed and scalability of Loki clusters.

## Bug Fixes and Changes üêõ

- Added support for Kubernetes version 1.30 and 1.31

- **New schema and store for Loki**: The Loki configuration has been extended to add the new TSDB store and v13 schema. There are two new elements in the configuration (note: **this is a breaking change**):

  ```yaml
  ...
  schema_config:
    ...
    - from: "2024-12-01"
      index:
        period: 24h
        prefix: index_
      object_store: s3
      schema: v13
      store: tsdb
  ...
  storage_config:
    ...
    tsdb_shipper:
      active_index_directory: /var/loki/index
      cache_location: /var/loki/cache
      cache_ttl: 24h
      resync_interval: 5s
      shared_store: s3
  ```

  The two pieces of new configuration introduced are:
  - The new schema config with TSDB and schema v13
  - The `tsdb_shipper` conf that configures the storage for TSDB

  The `from` in `schema_config` should be a string in `ISO 8601` date format and it represents the day starting from which Loki will record logs with the new store and schema.

  ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**:  Loki will assume the start of the day on the UTC midnight of the specified day.

## Breaking Changes üíî

- **Loki store and schema change:** A new store and schema has been introduced in order to improve efficiency, speed and scalability of Loki clusters.
