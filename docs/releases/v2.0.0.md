## New package: Welcome Banzai logging operator! 📕

This release completely removes the self managed fluentd and fluentbit stack in favor of the Banzai logging operator.

### Rationale

The Logging operator automates the deployment of fluentd and fluentbit, and it also manages their configuration.
You will be able to self-manage additional logging configurations, flows and outputs (for example, if you need to send
logs to another output)
without the need to patch the fluentd or fluentbit configuration directly.

## Update Guide 🦮

The update procedure is pretty straightforward, you just need to replace the old stack with the new one. There will be some downtime.

Remove the old fluentd and fluentbit stack:

```bash
kubectl delete ds fluentbit -n logging
kubectl delete sts fluentd -n logging
```

And apply the new stack:

```bash
kustomize build vendor/katalog/logging-operator | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build vendor/katalog/logging-operated | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build vendor/katalog/configs | kubectl apply -f -
```

> **NOTE**: *Run `kubectl apply` multiple times until you see no errors in the console*

If you did some custom configurations on top of the old fluentd package, you need to rewrite them using the new CRDs that
the operator provides [Logging Operator Documentation][logging-operator-docs].

> **NOTE**: inside the `configs` folder there are multiple logging configurations, you can pick only a subset of them to apply. See the `configs` [README.md](../../katalog/configs/README.md) for more information.

## New logging architecture, deep dive 🔬

The new logging architecture leverages the [Banzai Logging Operator](https://github.com/banzaicloud/logging-operator)
for all the logging configurations.

The main logging stack is composed by a fluentd StatefulSet and a fluent-bit DaemonSet.
fluent-bit DaemonSet gather logs from all the nodes, adds the metadata and sends them to the fluentd stack.
fluentd stack sends the logs to the configured destinations. The fluentd behaviour is configured via Flow, Outputs,
ClusterFlow and ClusterOutputs CRDs.
Every time one CRD is created or updated, a config check job is triggered.
If the configuration passes the check, the config is applied in a hot fashion to the fluentd stack.

### Configs

Type of available config packages:

- `katalog/configs`: all the configurations.
- `katalog/configs/kubernetes`: only the cluster wide pods logging configuration.
- `katalog/configs/ingress-nginx`: only the nginx-ingress-controller logging configuration.
- `katalog/configs/audit`: all the Kubernetes audit logs related configurations (with master selector and tolerations).
- `katalog/configs/events`: all the Kubernetes events related configurations (with master selector and tolerations).
- `katalog/configs/systemd`: all the systemd related configurations.
- `katalog/configs/systemd/common`: kubelet, docker, ssh systemd service logs configuration.
- `katalog/configs/systemd/etcd`: only the etcd service logs configuration (with master selector and tolerations).

Each of the above config packages has its own Flow/ClusterFlow and Output/ClusterOutput.

### Additional features

- The official Grafana dashboard is enabled in the logging stack
- ServiceMonitors and PrometheusRules are enabled in the logging stack
- Fluentd errors are pushed in a dedicated minio instance
