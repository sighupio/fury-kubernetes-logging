## New component: Welcome Banzai logging operator! ðŸ“•

This release completely removes the self managed fluentd and fluentbit stack in favor of the Banzai logging operator.

Why?

The Logging operator automates the fluentd and fluentbit deployment, and it also manages the configuration.
You will be able to self managed additional logging configurations , flows and outputs (for example, you need to send logs
to another output)
without the need to patch the fluentd or fluentbit configuration directly.

## Update Guide ðŸ¦®

Remove the old fluentd and fluentbit stack:

```bash
kubectl delete ds fluentbit -n logging
kubectl delete sts fluentd -n logging
```

And apply the new stack:

```bash
kustomize build vendor/katalog/logging-operator | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build vendor/katalog/logging-operated | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build vendor/katalog/configs | kubectl apply -f -
```

Note: inside the `configs` folder there are multiple logging configurations, you can pick only a subset of them to apply.
