# Loki Triple

<!-- <KFD-DOCS> -->

> ðŸš¨ This package is in technical preview and is subject to change.

Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus.
It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate.
It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

`loki-triple` is a high availability setup of Loki, that sets
up a 3-node cluster of `loki` for a robust and reliable setup.


## Requirements

- Kubernetes >= `1.21.0`
- Kustomize >= `v3.5.3`
- [prometheus-operator from KFD monitoring module][prometheus-operator]
- [grafana from KFD monitoring module][grafana]

> Prometheus Operator is necessary since we configure a `ServiceMonitor` to make
> some metrics available from `loki` on prometheus

## Image repository and tag

* Loki image: `grafana/loki`
* Loki repo: [Loki on Github][loki-gh]

## Configuration

Fury distribution Loki Stack Single is deployed with the following configuration:

- Single node
- Listens on port `3100` for client connections and metrics scraping
- Resource limits are `200m` for CPU and `512Mi` for memory
- Requires `10Gi` storage

## Deployment

You can deploy Loki Stack Single by running the following command in the root of
the project:

```shell
kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -
```
