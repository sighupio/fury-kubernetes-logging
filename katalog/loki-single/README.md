# Loki Single

<!-- <KFD-DOCS> -->

> ðŸš¨ This package is in technical preview and is subject to change.

Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus.
It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate.
It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes >= `1.21.0`
- Kustomize >= `v3.5.3`
- [prometheus-operator from KFD monitoring module][prometheus-operator]
- [grafana from KFD monitoring module][grafana] (module version `>=1.15.0`)

> Prometheus Operator is necessary since we configure a `ServiceMonitor` to make
> some metrics available from `loki` on prometheus

## Image repository and tag

* Loki image: `grafana/loki`
* Loki repo: [Loki on Github][loki-gh]
