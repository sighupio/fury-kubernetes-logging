# OpenSearch Triple

<!-- <KFD-DOCS> -->

OpenSearch is an open-source distributed search and analytics engine used for
log analytics. This package deploys a three-node OpenSearch cluster on
Kubernetes.

`opensearch-triple` is a high availability setup of OpenSearch, that sets
up a 3-node cluster of `OpenSearch` for a robust and reliable setup.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes >= `1.20.0`
- Kustomize >= `v3.3.X`
- [prometheus-operator][prometheus-operator]

> Prometheus Operator is necessary since we configure a `ServiceMonitor` to make
> some metrics available from `opensearch` on prometheus. Please refer,
> [`opensearch-single](../opensearch-single/README.md#alerts) to read
> about the available Prometheus rules.
